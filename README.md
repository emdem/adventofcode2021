Directories are labeled by day... Inputs are checked in with solutions.

If multi-part problems are present, solution will be named "solution_part#.rs"

to compile you will need rust and some glibc bits... simply:

    rustc solution.rs
    ./solution

from the directory containing the solution source files.
